                   Page Models
Typically, in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications, single page navigation model is used.

Important features are −

A single page navigation model maintains all the context of your application and additional content and data into a central frame.

You can divide the content of your application into multiple pages. However, when moving from one page to another, your application loads the pages into a main page form.

Neither the main page of your application is unloaded nor the code and data is unloaded, it makes it easier to manage state, and provide smoother transition animations between pages.

Multi-page navigation is also used for navigating between different pages or screens without worrying about the application context. In multi-page navigation, each page has its own set of functions, user interface and data etc.

Multi-pages navigation is typically used in web pages within the website.
